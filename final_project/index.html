				<p>There are 3 types of burgers. One that is good, one that is better and one made by australians. Now that you know that, let me tell you a secret: I love burgers. If you know me you will know that if there is a burger on the menu I will order it. I like to keep it simple, other than the occasional fried egg, just lettuce, tomato, ketchup- and then you can really enjoy what makes a burger, well, a burger.<br><br>
				The 3 real types of burgers are pretty easy to distinguish, but know that one type is not necessarily better than another. It really is just a matter of taste (get it?!?) as to which you prefer.<br><br>

The Greasy Burger - This one tends to have thinner patties, and you often have the option to get a double patty burger. These are typically cooked well done, and they don't ask. And it's best that when they don't ask, don't tell.<br><br>

The Meaty Burger - This burger has a nice, thick patty. You (well, I do) will need to cut it in half in order to eat it properly, or at least not fall apart. This will be cooked to order, which means you should never order it well done. (We all know what happens then...) <br><br>

The Slider - These burgers can vary from place to place, but they are mini-burgers on mini-buns and typically come in 3's. And they say bad things happen in 3's, guess you will just have to keep eating...

Locations: 432 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011 (10th Street) & 225 Liberty St, New York, NY 10281 (near wtc)<br><br>

Type of Burger: meaty burger<br><br>

Pricing: burgers range from $11-$15, but everything else is extra, to add fries is $3, so dining will usually end up around $20. Add shared starters and a drink and it's more like $40.<br><br>

My Review: overall, it's a good burger, meaty and not over cooked. Even comes with a branded bun, in case you forget where you are. Their fries are great, even greater sweet potato fries, but the truffle fries are, well, very truffley, unless you like that kinda thing. They have some maple bacon sweet potato fries, that get close to 1,000 calories if you want to splurge. Oh, and the onion rings are amazing. There are some pretty adventurous burger options on there, so if you like adventure, this is a great place to try.<br><br>

To sum it up: one of the good ones

   			 			<h3>DELICATESSEN</h3>
Location: 54 Prince Street, New York, NY 10012 (corner of Lafayette St.)<br><br>

Type of Burger: meaty burger<br><br>

Pricing: a little more expensive, burgers start in the $15 - $20 range plus any add ons (like cheese) but includes fries.<br><br>

My Review: excellent burger, hearty and cooked perfectly. Getting a fried egg adds to the perfection. They also have to-die-for cheeseburger spring rolls, their specialty. The fries are also pair well with the burger. They are famous for their macbar as well, where there are a plethora of variations of mac and cheese, that even comes in a cool macaroni shaped bowl.<br><br>

To sum it up: great trendy place in soho, go on your company's dime and order everything. or book the room downstairs for a company happy hour.  			 						</p>

shhh! it's a secret! but jokes on them...i'm going to tell you where it is. and trust me, it's worth it. i wouldn't risk it all if it wasn't.<br><br>

Location: Le Parker Meridian 119 W 56th St, New York, NY 10019 (btwn 6th & 7th Ave)<br><br>

Type of Burger: greasy burger + "the works"<br><br>

Pricing: great price, but the add on's will push you into the $10-$20 range. still a good deal for dinner in nyc.<br><br>

My Review: the wait may be a bit long, and you have to fight for a seat. It has that prohibition type of feel, given the contrast of the fancy schmancy hotel that surrounds the red velvet drapes this joint is encompassed in. get the fries (big enough to share for 2) and DEFINITELY get a milkshake. and be ready to order when you get to the front of the line or no burger for you!<br><br>

To sum it up: just go. don't tell your friends. okay, only your really good friends.

i'm just a girl who loves burgers. and fridays.<br><br>

<h1>WHY FRIDAYS?</h1>

<p>you all know how fridays feel. you made it! you should reward yourself for your hard work throughout the week. this all started at work, about 5 years ago, and it just stuck - i was an advocate of keeping the tradition going, and have carried this on to other jobs. plus burger friday just had a nice ring to it - making the word "friday" sound that much sweeter (and mouthwatering). <br><br>

what else is there to look forward to each week, really?<br><br>
